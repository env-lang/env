# env

[Specification for .env](env.md)

## Objectives

The .env file format aims to be a minimal, unambiguous configuration file format primarily used for setting environment variables in development environments. While the format has existed for many years with various implementations, this specification aims to standardize the expected behavior and provide clear guidance for parser implementations.

The env specification is a work in progress, you can view the document in its current state [here](env.md).

## Contributing

You are invited to contribute to the development of this specification by submitting a [pull request](../../pulls), opening [an issue](../../issues), or joining us in [the discussions](../../discussions).
